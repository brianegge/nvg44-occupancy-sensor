NGV44 ARRIS Wifi Presence

Use your ARRIS router to determine presence by who is currently connected to the WIFI. Based off of work by [@chadly](https://github.com/chadly) and [@fuzzysb](https://github.com/fuzzysb). See [the original discussion](https://community.smartthings.com/t/release-asuswrt-wifi-presence/37802).

The original code was not working for me with my [NVG448BQ](https://www.arris.com/products/nvg44x-xdsl-voice-gateway/). 

## Installation

Follow [the original instructions here](https://community.smartthings.com/t/release-asuswrt-wifi-presence/37802), but use the code from this repository.
